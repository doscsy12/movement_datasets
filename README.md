### Movement-related datasets
This is my own list of available movement-related datasets, that I refer to when I need to test new methods into my research.

[Mobilize Center](https://mobilize.stanford.edu/data/available-datasets/) 
<br> These datasets include inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, X-rays, MRIs, and more from both healthy and clinical populations.

[PhysioNet](https://www.physionet.org/about/database/)
<br> 

repository
<br> modenaxe / [awesome-biomechanics](https://github.com/doscsy12/awesome-biomechanics)

[biomechanist.net](https://www.biomechanist.net/multimedia-libraries/motion-library/)
<br> This library include experimental and OpenSim data of different sports and locomotion.

[gait data of elderly](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xgw6bg3g8h/1)
<br> This dataset is specifically for gait analysis, containing motion-capture data with demographic data, anthropometric measurements and performance assessments of older adults.

[RRD MyPredict database](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/01d30db7-95a8-4c39-afb9-4eb1a2f27539)
<br> This database of IMU and EMG data is allow researchers to develop algorithms that utilize sEMG signals to predict human motor intention.
